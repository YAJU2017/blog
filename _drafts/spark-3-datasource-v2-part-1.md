Spark 3.0 is a major release of Apache Spark framework. It's been in preview from last december and going to have stable release very soon. As part of major release, Spark has a habit of shaking up API's to bring it to latest standards. This means there will be breaking changes also. One of those major changes happening Datasource V2 API.

DataSource V2 API, a new datasource API for spark, was introduced in spark 2.3. Then it's been updated in spark 2.4. I have written detailed posts on [here](/categories/datasource-v2-series).

This API is going to be completely changed in Spark 3.0. Spark rarely change an API this frequent between releases. But as datasource are heart of the framework, they are refining as they find when there is better way to do things. Also in spark 2.4, these API's were marked **evolving**. This means they are meant to be changed in future.

In this series posts I will be discussing the new Datasource V2 API. This is the first post in the series where I will be discussing the motivation to update the API's.You can find all the posts in the series [here](/categories/datasource-v2-spark-three).


## Learning From Experience

The biggest motivation to change the abstractions came from using Datasource V2 API's for real sources. When spark team used to implement the file sources like csv, parquet and other streaming sources like Kafka they started to see the gaps. These gaps where more in the abstractions than the actual implementation itself. From this learning experience, it made them to this to relook the API and change the abstractions.

The below are some of the learnings


### Scan Execution Order is Not Obvious

V2 Read API introduced the mixins interfaces for everything like operator pushdown, column pruning. One of the reason for these high level interfaces was to have flexibility of mixing the only ones needed. This was major selling point of these new interfaces.

Even though these gave lot of flexibility they created confusion about order of their invocation. From the API it was not apparent which order these are called. Currently developer needed to depend upon the documentation. Depending upon the documentation means API is not good.


### Streaming API doesnâ€™t Play well with the Batch API

Streaming API doesn't support few of the features like FilterPushDown etc compared to batch API. But as the current API about mixins, it was hard to write a source which supports both streaming and batch as we need to skip some features selectively. So most of the cases it was handled by throwing exceptions for non supported features and handling it other places for streaming for API.


### Columnar Scan should not be Mixin Trait

Columnar scan is a Datasource V2 feature which allows reading data in columnar format. By default all the sources are implemented as row scan. As it's exposed as additional trait, all the default methods assume row based scanning. Currently it's not easy to define column scan only. The curent hack is to throw exception when row scanning is tried and control is handed over columnar way. This is hacky and not right.



The above are some of the learnings. You can read read more about the same in the design doc linked in refrence material.

## Conclusion

Datasource V2 brings major change to the way we write spark source. In Spark 3.0, this API is going through a major overhaul to integrate the learnings from wild. In this post we learned about all the motivation.
