The below video is a recording of my talk *Multi Source Data Analysis using Spark and Tellius* in recent spark meetup. In this talk, I discuss about how spark enables multi source analysis much easier than any another frameworks out there. I also demonstrate how this part of spark is used in [Tellius](http://www.tellius.com), analytics product which my company has developed in last 3 years.
